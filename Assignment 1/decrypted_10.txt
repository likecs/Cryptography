The whole point of cryptography is to keep the plaintext secret from eavesdroppers also called adversaries, attackers, interceptors, interlopers, intruders, opponents or simply the enemy. Eavesdroppers are assumed to have complete access to the communications between the sender and receiver. Cryptanalysis is the science of recovering the plaintext of a message without access to the key. Successful cryptanalyis may recover the plaintext or the key. It also may find weaknesses in a cryptosystem that eventually lead to the previous results. (The loss of a key through noncryptanalytic means is called a compromise).
