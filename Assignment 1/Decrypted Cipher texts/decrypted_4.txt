A cell may be considered alive till the chemical and physical changes inside the cell follow well characterized metabolic pathways and cell maintains homeostasis. The complexity of the molecules in the cell and their interactions manifests as what we call Life. In the absence of an entity which some people call soul, the cell exhibits remarkable properties. These properties emerge as a  consequence of the complexity of organization and function. This complex set of functions is what we could call life.
